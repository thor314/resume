I am an zero knowledge cryptography engineer and educator.
My work tends to alternate between implementations of novel zero-knowledge proof systems, such as Protostar and STARKs, and educational initiatives, such as the Uncloak Cryptography Engineering course, a 16 module course on general cryptography engineering practices.
I also co-organize industry events, most notably ZK Hack Hackathon series.

## Experience
### <span>Implementing zk-news</span> <span>Jan 2024-Present</span>
Implementing a hacker-news style discussion board, in coordination with the ZK Hack Discord group, intended to complement the ZK Mesh newsletter, and facilitate cross-domain communication in zero knowledge.
Initial release expected March 2024.

### <span>Stone Prover Reimplementation Grantee</span> <span>Nov 2023-Present</span>
In September 2023, Starkware open-sourced their proving library, the Stone Prover, a C++ library for generating FRI proofs over AIR traces generated from Cairo Assembly (CASM) programs. 
In the interest of developing an option for client-side proving, I am currently developing a minified Rust re-implementation of the Stone Prover, called [Pebble Stark](https://github.com/thor314/pebble-stark).

### <span>ZK Hack Co-organizer</span> <span>Apr 2023, Nov 2023</span>
Co-organized [ZK Hack](https://zkhack.dev/) [Lisbon](https://www.zklisbon.com/) and [ZK Hack Istanbul](https://www.zkistanbul.com/), a series of zero-knowledge hackathons.

### <span>Zuzalu Hackathon Winner</span> <span> Apr 2023</span>
Won the Zuzalu 2023 Hackathon for [partial implementation](https://github.com/thor314/ccs-hack) of the CCS generalized arithmetization scheme, with Waylon Jepsen and Shumo Chu.

### <span>Uncloak Cryptography</span> <span>Nov 2022-Apr 2023</span>
[Uncloak](https://github.com/thor314/uncloak) is a fledgling cryptography wiki and cryptography engineering course, aiming to increase the accessibility of cryptography engineering as a discipline for interested software engineers, supported under a grant by the Ethereum Foundation.

### <span>Proofs Arguments and Zero Knowledge Study group Co-runner</span> <span> Dec 2021-Dec 2022</span>
Initiated and co-ran the Zero Knowledge [cryptography study group](https://github.com/thor314/pazk) with the good [Dr. Justin Thaler](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/), which you can find through [the zkHack discord server](discord.com/invite/tHXyEbEqVN).

### <span>Lead Cryptography Engineer at Entropy Cryptography</span> <span>Nov 2021-Nov 2022</span>
Led cryptography engineering at [entropy](https://entropy.xyz/), a trustless, chain-agnostic asset custodian, built with threshold signatures, and the Substrate blockchain building framework. 
Designed and implemented the [GG20](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/114.pdf) threshold signature scheme.

### <span>Paper coauthor: Combining GHOST and Casper</span> <span>Dec 2018-July 2019</span>
coauthored a mathematical security paper with my mentor Yan Zhang analyzing the security and liveness properties of the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain consensus protocol. [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03052).
